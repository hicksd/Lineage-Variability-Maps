## C. elegans data

This folder is a placeholder for data that must be downloaded from http://digital-development.org/Batch-download/WT.zip

These data are described in:
Santella A, Kovacevic I, Herndon LA, Hall DH, Du Z, Bao Z. Digital development: a database of cell lineage differentiation in C. elegans with lineage phenotypes, cell-specific gene functions and a multiscale model. Nucleic Acids Research. 2016;44(D1):D781â€“D785. doi:10.1093/nar/gkv1119. 

RW10348 nhr-25 (hypodermal), RW10425 pha-4 (pharynx), RW10434 cnd-1 (neuronal)

In cell lineage tree measurements, each lineal position is given a label. The *.json files in this folder provide the mapping between the standard labeling convention used for the worm, and the generic binary labeling convention used in lineage variability maps. Labels were originally sourced from wormweb.org.
