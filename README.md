## Lineage Variability Maps

A cell lineage tree is a measurement of the phenotype(s) of, and the family relationships between, cells descended from a common founder cell. Lineage variability maps provide a quantitative language for describing the sources of variation throughout cell lineage trees.

In simple organisms such as the worm, C. elegans, different founder cells give rise to the same pattern of phenotypes across the cell lineage tree. The resulting fixed pattern, called a lineage map, has long helped show where in the lineage different cell fates are specified and determined. In more complex organisms, the lineage trees descended from different founder cells exhibit considerable variation. This makes it impossible to draw a single lineage map.

Lineage variability maps address this problem by elevating the concept of the lineage map to the population level, providing a way to locate the regions of the lineage tree that are particularly important for cellular differentiation. A full description of the technique is described in the following manuscript:

Note that, to analyze the worm data, previously-published C. elegans data should be downloaded separately from the original database (see readme file in the Worm-WT folder).
